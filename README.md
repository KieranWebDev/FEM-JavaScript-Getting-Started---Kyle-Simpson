## Front End Masters: Getting Started with JS with Kyle Simpson

## 3 pillars of JS: Types/Coercions, Scope/Closures, this/prototypes.

### Types/Coercions:

- Primitive types
- NaN
- new
- Coercion
    - Number +Number = Number
    - Number + String = String
    - String + Number = String
    - String + String = String
- Booleans
    - Falsy: 0, null, NaN, false, undefined
    - Truthy: string, number, {}, [], true, function(){}

A quality JS program embraces coercions, making sure the types involved in every operation are clear.

Important to know that types you are working with and make them obvious in your code.

### Scope and Closures

- Undefined vs Undeclared
    - Undefined: A variable that has been declared but doesnâ€™t have a value.
    - Undeclared: A variable that was never declared anywhere. When you try  to reference it JS has no idea where it is.
- Function expression
    - A function that is assigned as a value somewhere.
